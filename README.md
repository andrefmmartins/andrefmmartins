# 👋 Hi, pals! I'm André and I'm a Tech Sourcer!
- Working for the largest eCommerce platform in Africa!
- Mostly looking for talent for _Data, Cloud & Security_


### Find me around the web!🌍
Of course, I'm on 🧐 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andréfmmartins/) as one of my main sourcing tools. Simultaneously, I'm also on 🦆 [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrefmmartins). As a gamer (not as much as in the past), I'm on 🎮 [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonforcept/) where I like to engage with friends and people mostly around amazing games like Football Manager (FM2020), Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CS:GO), and Town of Salem (ToS).
